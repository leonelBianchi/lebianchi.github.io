Hi. I study Civil Enginering at Universidad Tecnológica Nacional Facultad Regional Buenos Aires, where I am researcher and teaching assistant. I´m from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

I have been working on research projects on computational models, numerical methods and artificial intelligence applied to structural dynamics.

Now, I´m studying and interested in projects related to machine learning, artificial intelligence, etherum and climate change.

## Experience 

<u>Researcher at Universidad Tecnológica Nacional Facultad Regional Buenos Aires
</u> <br>
Software development for engineering applications. Working on a project to detect damage to civil structures such as buildings and bridges, using machine learning to achieve remote monitoring at low cost.

<u>Math Professor
</u> <br>
Classes in mathematics, algebra and mathematical analysis I and II  for engineers.

<u>Civil Engineer Assistant
</u> <br>
Design of civil engineering documentation in AutoCAD for private clients, like plans of steel and concrete structures, architecture, sanitary facilities and more.

<u>Assistant Professor
</u> <br>
Ad honorem assistant in the subject advanced calculus of the 4th year of the engineering career at UTN FRBA. Topics include numerical methods, octave and python programming exercises, simulation practice with Abaqus.
