Organisms grow by increasing the mass of cells (or the number of cells) in their bodies. This is achieved by providing the cells with nutrients and oxygen and removing waste products. Organisms have developed several mechanisms to ensure that growth is balanced by the death of particular cells. If the process is not balanced, the organism grows exponentially: a doubling of the mass of cells occurs every fixed time interval.
In the following, we will explore exponential growth in two related contexts: one applying to mortal beings and another to immortal beings.<br><br>

Aging is a form of exponential growth. The main reason it grows exponentially is that it is a process whereby cells are removed from the organism. If cells are not removed, they continue to divide and grow, leading to an organism of ever increasing size. In fact, in the absence of cell death, all organisms would grow to an enormous size.<br><br>

The process of aging can be viewed as a cell-removal process. In the absence of cell removal, cells continue to grow and grow. Therefore, cell removal must be the key mechanism that prevents immortality. This implies that aging is an essential part of life. As such, it cannot be eliminated, and aging must be understood in the context of the benefits it provides.<br><br>

Unlimited growth of cells is not the only problem to be solved in the context of life. A related problem is how to keep the size of the organism small to make it easy for the cells to move around. As an organism grows larger, the distance that cells must travel to reach nutrients or oxygen increases. This implies that there must be a mechanism to keep the size of the organism small.<br><br>

The answer to this problem was discovered over a decade ago. The theory of evolution by natural selection led to the elaboration of an underlying principle that explains the development of all complex and efficient biological systems. The principle states that biological structures and processes are created to be as economical as possible. The principle explains why growth should be limited.<br><br>

The mechanism that limits growth is as follows. Due to the limited availability of nutrients and oxygen, an organism must compete to obtain them. This competition leads to a struggle for survival. As a result, organisms have developed a mechanism that limits the amount of cells in a particular region of the body. This mechanism is called apoptosis, or programmed cell death.<br><br>

Programmed cell death results in a specific set of cells dying in a particular region of the body. As a result, the number of cells in a region does not increase indefinitely. The result is that the size of the organism is kept small.<br><br>

Programmed cell death also explains the observation that the number of cells in an organism is balanced by the number of cells dying. This balance explains why organisms are of a particular size.<br><br>

Programmed cell death also plays an important role in evolution. It provides a way of eliminating cells that are less efficient. As a result, the organisms that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive. Programmed cell death is therefore the mechanism that leads to biological evolution.<br><br>

Programmed cell death has an important implication: if a particular type of cell is not needed by the body, it will be removed. If the cells in a particular region are not needed, they will be eliminated. The result is that the number of cells in the body is determined by the number needed by the body.<br><br>

Programmed cell death also has an important implication in the context of aging. The implication is that aging is a process of eliminating cells that are not needed. The result is that the body is rid of cells that are not required for survival. This in turn leads to a reduction in the amount of cells in the body.<br><br>

The implication of aging being a process of eliminating cells that are not required can be used to explain some of the observations related to aging. For example, it can explain why some organs are more affected by aging than others. This is because those organs have a larger number of cells that are not required by the body.<br>
