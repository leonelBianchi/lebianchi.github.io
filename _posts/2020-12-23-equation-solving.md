description: "It was needed to solve an equation to get a useful metric, but it was also necessary that the solution be expressed in a very simple way. It turns out that to solve it, you need to use the LambertW function. Since we needed a simple formula as a solution, we came up with an indirect way to solve it."

How would you solve the following equation?


\begin{align*}
$$\frac{1-$e^{-$($\frac{x}{$\psi}$)^{k}$}$}{x}$ = $\frac{k}{$\psi}$ $$\frac{x}{$\psi}$^{k-1}$ $e^{-$($\frac{x}{$\psi}$)^{k}$}$ $
\end{align*}
