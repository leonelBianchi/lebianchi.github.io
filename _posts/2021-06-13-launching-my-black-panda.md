<span style="color:black">My Black Panda is only a random name. The idea behind the black panda is to share knowledge but in a somewhat extraordinary way. In short, it is an indirect tool for generating ideas. Why indirect? Because ideas are not requested, explanations are requested. But from those explanations, ideas emerge. Is that how it works.

## General Idea

MyBlackPanda is a general idea, a project in search of generating knowledge and improving learning.The key is where that knowledge to be shared comes from. At this first iteration, it comes from the GPT-3 deep learning model created by OpenAI but new tools will be incorporated in near future. I was given access to the API a long time ago and what I could see is that it is tremendously good at associating concepts. I realized that I learned a lot from the texts that I obtained and at the same time I could never use it for something productive, like writing emails. That is why I came up with this, share texts where the model explains something. We just provide a request and we get the text. The request is based on requesting a text from the model that explains and relates concepts. Anyway, you can find the texts in the My Black Panda tab on the left sidebar or clicking <a href="/myblackpanda">here</a>

## Uses

Firstly, it can be used to learn. Secondly, it can be used to teach. Finally, it can be used to build.
