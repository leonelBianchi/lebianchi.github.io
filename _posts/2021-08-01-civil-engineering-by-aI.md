*The following text is part of a series of texts generated by OpenAI's GPT-3, a deep learning model for natural language processing.They are not just any texts, they seek to explain something. What I try to do is combine concepts and see how the model relates them and generates new ideas.Basically, I only indicate to the model the phrase written in "input". Everything else is generated by the model*

<b>Input: What is the future of civil engineering?</b>

Engineers have a crucial role to play in the future of civil engineering. The job market is expected to increase. There is a growing focus in the world on developing infrastructure. This will require civil engineers to design and build new structures. The world is also facing challenges of climate change and the problem of pollution. Civil engineers will be needed to build new infrastructure systems and facilities that are environmentally friendly.

There are many opportunities for civil engineers. Employment opportunities are expected to increase in both the private and public sectors. Engineers who have the right training and skills will have the best opportunities.

<b>What are the different types of civil engineering jobs?<b>

Civil engineers can get employment in a number of different sectors. They can work in the construction industry, in the public sector or in private companies. They can even work in their own business as self-employed engineers.

The different sectors have different types of roles. For example, in the construction industry, engineers will work on building new structures. They will design and build roads, bridges and power stations. They will also design new structures based on the latest computer modelling. Civil engineers who work in the public sector will work on projects that benefit the wider community. Examples include building sewage systems, water supply networks and flood defences. They will be responsible for the safety of the structures they build. Civil engineers who work in the private sector will design and build structures that will be used by large companies. They will also work on projects that are paid for by private companies.

In all of these sectors, there are different specialisms that civil engineers can get employed in. These include:

<b>Structural engineer</b>: engineers who deal with the design and building of structures. They will design buildings, bridges, roads and power stations. They will also design steel structures like bridges.

<b>Hydraulic engineer</b>: engineers who deal with the design and building of water and sewerage networks. They will design and build storm water, waste water and drinking water networks. They will also design dams, reservoirs and flood control systems.

<b>Transport engineer</b>: engineers who deal with the design and building of roads, rail networks, airports and harbours. They will design and build roads, pavements, tunnels and bridges. They will also design and build traffic management systems and public transport networks.

<b>Geotechnical engineer</b>: engineers who deal with the design and building of structures that are built on the ground. They will design structures that are built on soft or unstable ground like foundations for buildings, bridges and tunnels. They will also design retaining walls and dams.

<b>Environmental engineer</b>: engineers who deal with the design and building of structures that are not in the ground. They will design and build treatment systems for sewerage and water supplies. They will also design and build air pollution control systems.

<b>Geological engineer</b>: engineers who deal with the design and building of structures that are built in the ground. They will design and build underground structures such as mines. They will also design and build structures that are built on soft or unstable ground.

As well as the different sectors and specialisms, there are also different kinds of civil engineer careers that you can work in.

<b>Consulting engineer</b>: engineers who work on projects that are paid for by private companies. They will work in the office and will work with the client to design and build structures. They will also work on the site to supervise the engineers who are building the structure.

<b>Project engineer</b>: engineers who work on a specific project. They will work on the design and building of a specific structure. They will work in the office and on the site. They will also carry out inspections and supervise other engineers who are building the structure.

<b>Contract engineer</b>: engineers who work on specific construction projects. They will work as part of a team of engineers and designers. They will work on a specific project for a set period of time. They will work on the design and building of the structure. They will also do regular inspections of the structure to make sure that it meets the required standards.

In the public sector, these types of careers are called civil service roles.

If you are interested in any of these careers, you will usually need to do a degree in civil engineering.


<b>How will civil engineering be affected by machine learning?</b>

Predictive analytics are already used in civil engineering to predict the strength of materials and structures, and the effects of loads and temperatures.

Today’s use of analytics is at the heart of this exponential change. With the help of machine learning, predictive analytics can be applied to a much wider range of processes that will help improve civil engineering in the future.

Greater use of sensors in civil engineering will provide more information about structures and materials, allowing continuous monitoring that will improve safety and reduce the need to build unnecessary structures.

For example, a sensor could be embedded in a concrete bridge to measure its quality and detect any potential problems, such as cracks, early on. This will help to reduce maintenance costs and the need for repairs.

Machine learning can also be used to predict the behaviour of materials, such as soil and concrete, to help predict how materials will respond to various stresses and loads.

This information can then be used in civil engineering to make better building materials, and to help with the development of new building techniques, such as 3D printing.

Machine learning can also be used to speed up the modelling of buildings, bridges and other structures. The models can then be used to test how the structures will perform, rather than having to build them.

This will allow us to build structures that are more efficient and safer, and speed up the construction process.

Machine learning is not just disrupting the fields of technology, business and education but also the way we live and work. It will be a great tool for civil engineers, helping to make design and construction processes more efficient, and allowing us to build structures that are safer, more durable, and help the environment.

With the help of machine learning, we can reduce the amount of time and money needed to build and repair structures, and also accelerate the development of new materials and building methods.

<b>How will civil engineering be affected by blockchain technology?</b>

The future of blockchain is uncertain. The technology is still in its infancy. As it matures, we will see more and more applications of blockchain in our daily lives. If you ask me, I would say that the future of civil engineering is more secured with the advent of blockchain.

Here’s why. Imagine the challenges of the construction industry today. There is a high possibility that the money you paid for a home is not the cost it cost the builder to build that home. The contractor might have inflated the price of the home. The building material might have been substituted for a cheaper alternative. There is lack of transparency in the construction industry.

The builder might also have used substandard building material and cheated the client. There is a possibility that the builder might have used a lower quality material to boost his profits. Imagine all these possibilities.

Blockchain technology can help the construction industry eliminate all these possibilities. It can help the industry become transparent. Blockchain technology can help the industry get rid of all these possibilities. Blockchain can help the industry maintain a high level of transparency.

Blockchain can be used to record all the data associated with a construction project. The data can include the quality of material used, the quantity of material used, the cost of building material, the cost of labor involved in the project, the cost of machine used, the cost of transportation, etc. The data can be stored on a blockchain and shared with all stakeholders.

This will eliminate all possibilities of the builder cheating the client. The building material used will be genuine. The quality of material used will be genuine. The cost of material will be genuine. There will be no possibility of the builder using substandard materials.

Blockchain will also help maintain a high level of transparency in the construction industry. Blockchain will help you know how the money you paid for a house has been used. You will know if the money you paid for your house has been used in a criminal activity. You will know if the money you paid for your house has been used in an illegal activity. You will know if you have been cheated by a builder or a developer.

Blockchain will help you take a closer look at a project. You will be able to track the progress of a project. You will be able to track the cost of a project. You will be able to track the quality of material used in a project

<b>How to build an earthquake resistant building?</b>

When the earth shakes, buildings may suffer damage. A building can be designed to be resistant to shaking. The building must be able to:

* Absorb the energy of the earthquake

* Disperse the energy of the earthquake

* Dissipate the energy of the earthquake

## Conclusion and Comments

The GPT-3 generated text talks about civil engineering at a deep level, since it not only understands what civil engineering is, it also knows how a project is carried out. In addition, it knows about physical mechanisms of material and the best part is in the end, when it explains that an earthquake resistant design must dissipate the energy of the earthquake (it's not an obvious statement, being that for other kind of phenomena, such as wind, energy dissipation is not the main design criteria). Finally, the way it links traditional civil engineering projects with machine learning and blockchain, makes us think that the model not only understands what are each of them by definition, it also knows how to generate new ideas from them.
