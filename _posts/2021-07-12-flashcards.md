*The following text is part of a series of texts generated by OpenAI's GPT-3, a deep learning model for natural language processing.They are not just any texts, they seek to explain something. What I try to do is combine concepts and see how the model relates them and generates new ideas.Basically, I only indicate to the model the phrase written in "input". Everything else is generated by the model*
